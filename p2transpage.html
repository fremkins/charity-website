                    This is a charity made by Joseph Giovani
                due to the wildfires <br> misplacing animals from their 
                habitats and causing endless destruction in its 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                    As a man who has worked as a Wildfire Lookout he knew
                the dangers and risks of both <br> the before of the wildfire 
                and its aftermath effects on the environment and how it 
                impacts both humans and animals
            </p>
                
            <p>
                    This charity is a way to show our love and support for 
                both animals and people in need and show that our community will 
                always have each other's backs.
