                    This is a charity made by Jorel Mendoza in an attempt 
                to create more support groups for queer students in schools 
                and communities.
            <p>
                    Being a student I knew I couldn't do much else other 
                than try to convince the school to create queer-friendly spaces
                for his classmates and this is an attempt in a movement for not 
                just his school but also other schools to make safer environments
                for their queer students. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                    This charity is a way to show our love and support for 
                those teenagers and hopefully get schools to further more 
                support their students in their self-expression and identity.
