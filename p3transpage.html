                    This is a charity made by Chesca Arqabioso for providing
                shelter and support for teens who have been thrown out of their
                homes due to coming out or being outed by peers.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                    Being a mother herself, she knows that the safety and 
                happiness of a child far more outweighs anything else when 
                you are a parent, therefore she decided that the cases of 
                homelessness is rising due to the cruelty of certain parents 
                and wishes to help them as much as she can.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                    We hope this charity will make others feel seen and 
                cared for especially in these hard times.
            </p>

                    Thank you, to all those that donate!
