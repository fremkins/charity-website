                    This is a charity made by Frederick Ram who would like 
                to support <br> transgender teens and get the medical care 
                that they need. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                    As a transgender teen themselves, they know the value of 
                being able to start as early as possible when it comes to 
                hormone blockers and the other hormonal treatments
                needed, as this sets them up for an easier time in 
                adulthood. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                    This charity is a way to show our love and support for 
                those teenagers in need and show that our community will 
                always have each other's backs. 
            </p>

                    Thank you, to all those that donate!
