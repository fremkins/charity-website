                    This is a charity made by Lunala Astro regarding the numerous amounts
                of stray animals found on the street abandoned by their owners.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                    Pets should never be abandoned, sometimes circumstances call for measures 
                like that but there's a reason we have developed shelters for these <br> animals to 
                go to and find a better chance at having a home. Abandoning them in the streets
                makes it dangerous for both them and the neighborhood around, putting all at risk.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                    This charity was made to show awareness and hopefully convince others to 
                take action whend it comes to these concerns about both animals and our community.
            </p>

                    Thank you, to all those that donate!
